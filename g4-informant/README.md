## Welcome to G4 Informant

G4 Informant is a webapplication that let our users create and display their very own screen.
You are able to choose from a range of components that will display different information.

## Commands

Using Node, these are the commands you need to run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Database

The database script is built in a PostgreSQL environment,
so you'd need to use one yourself or manually change the script to work with whichever database you wanna use.
